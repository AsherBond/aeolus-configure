#Default setup configuration.

#Set everything up on this box.
#You can override the default behavior
#by creating <fqdn>_configure with the
#class membership and parameters as
#desire and it will take precedence over this.

#NOTE:  Although this suggests the components
#can be deployed on individual boxes.  This will likely
#become a common practice, but be advised that currently
#apart from https on the web server for conductor, you should
#consider intermachine communications insecure.  Securing
#intermachine service calls is on the roadmap.
