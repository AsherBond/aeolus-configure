The Deltacloud Recipe and Appliance

You can find more documentation at the Deltacloud web site at
http://deltacloud.org/


Prerequisites
-------------

The deltacloud appliance makes uses of the deltacloud recipe rpm
to install and configure all components. The appliance is built
using the appliance tools and is deployed via libvirt

See http://thincrust.net/ and http://libvirt.org/ for more information.

Some commands require root access.  Those commands will be executed using sudo, so ensure that
the user building the appliance has an appropriate entry in /etc/sudoers.


Building and Installing the Deltacloud Recipe
---------------------------------

$ rake rpms

The rpm will be placed into the pkg build dir, install it via yum
$ sudo yum install --nogpgcheck \
    build/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/deltacloud_recipe-0.0.3-1.fc13.noarch.rpm

Install the recipe via
$ sudo /usr/sbin/dc-install

Uninstall it via
$ sudo /usr/sbin/dc-uninstall

Starting the Appliance
-----------------------------------

Run the following command from the appliance project checkout directory

$ rake image:deploy

This will start the appliance via libvirt bringing up virt-viewer for
graphical access. If the appliance is already found running locally this
will fail, and you will have to run the following to destroy and delete
the appliance.

$ rake image:destroy

NOTE this will destroy the image, make sure to backup any changes to it
