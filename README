The Deltacloud Appliance

You can find more documentation at the Deltacloud web site at
http://deltacloud.org/


Prerequisites
-------------

To fully build the appliance from source you will need to create the the
deltacloud_appliance rpm containing the puppet recipe. Create the appliance
using the Thincrust appliance creator. And boot the appliance using libvirt.

See http://thincrust.net/ and http://libvirt.org/ for more information.

Some commands require root access.  Those commands will be executed using sudo, so ensure that
the user building the appliance has an appropriate entry in /etc/sudoers.


Building deltacloud_appliance.rpm and creating the appliance
---------------------------------

The build process is largely automated via rake:
$ rake image:create

Starting the Appliance
-----------------------------------

Run the following command from the appliance project checkout directory

$ rake image:deploy

This will start the appliance via libvirt bringing up virt-viewer for
graphical access. If the appliance is already found running locally this
will fail, and you will have to run the following to destroy and delete
the appliance.

$ rake image:destroy

NOTE this will destroy the image, make sure to backup any changes to it
